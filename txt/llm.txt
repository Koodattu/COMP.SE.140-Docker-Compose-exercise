For this assignment, I used ChatGPT as an AI tool to assist me with understanding Docker and Docker Compose, 
and to write parts of the Python and Node.js applications.

The AI helped me understand how to structure Dockerfiles, 
especially when I encountered errors with missing Linux utilities like ps and uptime. 
It guided me on how to install those utilities inside the containers. 
I also had trouble with formatting the JSON output, 
and the AI showed me how to break down the output of system commands like ps -ax and df -h into a more readable format.

Another big area where the AI was useful was in structuring the docker-compose.yaml file and linking the two services. 
I had some confusion about how containers communicate over Docker networks, 
but the AI provided explanations and examples, which made it easier to implement.

However, there were some things the AI couldnâ€™t help with directly. 
For example, I still had to test and debug the code in my own environment. 
Sometimes, the AI gave overly complex solutions when simpler ones worked fine. 
Overall, using ChatGPT helped me save time and understand Docker better, 
but I had to combine it with testing and research to get everything working smoothly.
